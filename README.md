# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.  The primary purpose of this project was to use JQuery in addition with AJAX to update the webpage without having to reload the page.  This project provided me with the opportunity to develop SASS files for easy conversion to CSS.  In addition, if the user tries to post an empty tweet or a tweet with more than 140 characters the app will prompt an error message with JQuery to slide down.
